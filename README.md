> Run a node.js module in a separate process using cluster.

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install run-on-worker
```

## Usage

```js
// worker.js
process.once('uncaughtException', process.exit.bind(process, 1));
process.once('unhandledRejection', process.exit.bind(process, 1));
process.once('message', request => {
  try {
    const message = JSON.parse(request);
    const response = message.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
    process.send(JSON.stringify({ response }));
  } catch (err) {
    process.send(JSON.stringify({ error: { message: err.message, code: 42 } }));
  }
  process.exit();
});

// main.js
async function sum (values) {
  const workerFile = path.resolve(__dirname, 'worker.js');
  return runOnWorker(workerFile, values);
}

try {
  const result = await sum([ 2, 3, 6 ]); // 11
} catch (err) {
}
```

## API

<a name="runOnWorker"></a>

## runOnWorker(workerFile, message, onProgress) â‡’ <code>\*</code>
Run a process on a worker and return the results.

The worker will receive a JSON stringified message object and should return
a JSON stringified { response: 'what you want returned' } object. If there
is an error response that can be returned with a JSON stringified
{ error: { message, code } } object instead.

If you provided an onProgress function, it will get anything the worker sends back thusly:
```js
process.send(JSON.stringify({ progress: data }));
```

**Kind**: global function
**Returns**: <code>\*</code> - JSON.parsed response from the worker
**Throws**:

- WorkerError


| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| workerFile | <code>string</code> | file to run as the worker process |
| message | <code>\*</code> | anything that can be JSON stringified to be went to the   worker process. |
